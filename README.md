# Winning-Jeopardy
What should you do to win Jeopardy?

Trying to gain an advantage in Jeopardy? In this project, we will attempt to find any possible patterns to give us an advantage over other contestants.

In order to accomplish this, we will:
* See how many times an answer itself shows up in a question
* Find if there are any overlaps between the questions of the past
* Perform a chi-squared test to see if we can determine if certain terms correspnd to high or low value questions.
